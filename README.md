### 📌 Importance of Identifying Design Properties in Mock-Up

Identifying design properties such as colors and typography is crucial when translating mock-up designs into functional components. It ensures:
- 🔄 **Consistency** in visuals and user experience across the application
- 🚀 **Faster development** by reducing guesswork for developers
- 🎨 **Brand alignment** through a cohesive visual identity
- 🔍 **Accessibility and readability** by using proper font sizes and color contrast
- 🧱 **Component reusability** since design tokens (like colors and fonts) are standardized

This alignment between the Figma mock-up and the actual UI improves both teamwork and product quality.
## 👥 Project Roles and Responsibilities

To ensure smooth collaboration and effective delivery, the following roles are defined in the project:

| **Role**             | **Responsibilities** |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Project Manager**  | Oversees the entire project, coordinates the team, ensures deadlines are met, manages risks, and communicates progress with stakeholders. |
| **Frontend Developers** | Build and maintain the UI components using React, ensure mobile responsiveness, handle state management, and integrate with backend APIs. |
| **Backend Developers** | Design and develop RESTful APIs, manage database interactions, handle authentication, and implement business logic. |
| **Designers**         | Create UI mockups using Figma, define color styles and typography, ensure consistency in user experience and visual aesthetics. |
| **QA/Testers**        | Write and execute test cases, perform functional and usability testing, report bugs, and ensure quality assurance before deployment. |
| **DevOps Engineers**  | Set up CI/CD pipelines, manage deployments, monitor server infrastructure, and ensure system reliability and performance. |
| **Product Owner**     | Defines product vision and features, prioritizes tasks, gathers feedback, and represents the stakeholders' interests. |
| **Scrum Master**      | Facilitates Agile ceremonies, removes blockers, promotes team collaboration, and ensures the team follows Scrum practices. |

Each role plays a vital part in the success of the project, and effective communication and collaboration between them ensure that the end product meets the desired goals.
## 🧩 UI Component Patterns

To ensure a consistent, reusable, and scalable frontend architecture, the following UI components are planned for the AirBnB Clone project:

### 🔷 Navbar
- Displays site logo
- Includes search bar for property listings
- Provides navigation links (e.g., Login, Signup, Bookings)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop views

### 🔷 Property Card
- Shows property image thumbnail
- Includes brief details: title, price per night, location, and rating
- Features a favorite (heart) icon
- Designed for responsiveness in grid view

### 🔷 Footer
- Contains company information and legal links
- Social media icons/links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram)
- Responsive layout with clean design for mobile and desktop

Each of these components will be designed with **reusability**, **maintainability**, and **accessibility** in mind, following a consistent styling approach defined by the Figma design mock-ups.
